This mobile OCR app won me a "Nerd Cred" award (most technologically challenging) during a 3-day hackathon. "Whazzat?!" allows you to identify any ambiguous-looking object using just your phone camera and an internet connection. Maybe you're travelling and want to know the name of a foreign dish, or maybe you're learning English and want to know the words for everyday things -- "Whazzat?!" to the rescue!
